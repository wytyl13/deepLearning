# @Description: we will will handle the statistics part of the paper what is about agriculture
# green technical efficiency used social sciences method. the construct about this paper is as follow.
# title:
#     the region differences of xinjiang agriculture green technical efficiency and the affecting factors analysis.

# the construct of the papaer
# start.
# abstract.
# keyword.
# ... some introduction ...
# 1 research methods and data sources.
#     1.1 research methods.
#         1.1.1 the measure of agriculture green technical efficiency.
#             invloved the DEA theory and expression, the measurement of the carbon emissions, all
#             indicators you have selected to calculate your agriculture green technical efficiency.
#         1.1.2 the measurement of the region difference.
#             what indicator you have selected to measure the region difference. thayer index or the other?
#             the expression and a brief description for your selected indicator. the standard about your
#             division in region. or you can referece others standard proposed by others.
#         1.1.3 the empirical analysis of the affecting factors about the agriculture green technical.
#             the empirical model, expression and some description about your indicators in this model.
#             you should distinguish the core index and other indicators. explain and be explained variables.
#             and some special pretreatment for you indicators should be also descripted.

#     1.2 data sources.
#         involved the original data sources and some pretreatment. 
# 2 the results and analysis
#     2.1 the temporal changes for agriculture green technical efficiency. 
#         you should introduce how to calculate the efficiency, use software or code by yourself?
#         and do some description about the retionality of statistics. just like F statistic or significance test.
#         you should at least list the following:
#         indicators, just like, the agriculture green technical efficiency for each year of each region.
#         a simple statistics involved the mean agriculture green technical efficiency for each region in all year.
#         the difference between the mean agriculture green technical efficiency of current year and the origianl year.
#         the mean agriculture green technical efficiency of all mean in all year.
#         of course, you can also define the variance about the two dimension array. you can just image this array
#         is a picture, if you imshow this array, it can show some reaction features. just like the mean of the
#         array means the mean efficiency for the whole array. it means the mean efficiency for xinjiang province.
#         the variance means the contrast for the whole array. you can caluculate the variance for the whole array.
#         it can show some issue. the bigger variance means the great change for agriculture green technical efficiency.
        
#         you should show one table for the above statistics and do a brief description based on the table.
#     2.2 the spatial distribution about the agriculture green technical efficiency.
#         you should at lest visualize the analysis results. just like you can show the efficiency of original year
#         and the current year first, second, you can define the efficiency level, you should at least define five levels.
#         0.0-0.2, 0.2-0.3, 0.3-0.4, 0.4-0.5, 0.5-1. or you can use clustering algorithm. then you should 
#         imshow the heat map about efficiency of each region in xinjiang.
#         then,  you can do some brief description about the heat map. and do some analysis.
#     2.3 the region differences for agriculture green technical efficiency.
#         visualize the thayer index result and descriped based on it.
#         you should at least use two figure to show the thayer index results. a histogram, a line chart.
#     2.4 the affecting factors analysis about the agriculture green technical efficiency.
#         how to calculate the empirical model. stata or other software. and do some specific description
#         about the model result. you should distinguish the different indicators to descript the result.
#         you should at least add one table for the stata regression results. a three wire table.
# 3 conclusion and implications.
#     3.1 the main conclusion.
#         1) the main result about the temporal changes for agriculture green technical efficiency
#         2) the main result about the spatial distribution features of each region for the efficiency.
#         3) thayer index result about difference of the region.
#         4) the main indicators that the main affecting factors to the agriculture green technical efficiency.
#     3.2 implications.
#         the advice about agriculture green technical efficiency.
#         the advice about the region difference for the efficiency.
#         the advice about the affecting factor for the efficiency.
